    "In this year's PhysioNet Challenge we will use a variety of physiological signals, collected during polysomnographic sleep studies, to detect these other sources of arousal (non-apnea) during sleep.\n",

    "- Excluding SaO2, all signals were sampled to 200 Hz\n",
    "- For analytic convenience, SaO2 was resampled to 200 Hz, and is measured as a percentage\n",
    "- The goal of the challenge is use information from the available signals to correctly classify target arousal regions. For the purpose of the Challenge, target arousals are defined as regions where either of the following conditions were met:"
